The inputs folder contains the metadata for the stream of ads and all the available moderators;

The are generated(and decoded) by the  MockAdvertisementBuilder and MockModeratorBuilder in the data/advertisement and data/moderator folders respectively.

Should be able to regenerate by running the generateInput.py file; can replace the builder with legit builder in the future.

The data package will automatically read, decode and generate advertisement and moderator manager objects.

Up to this line, I have tested the features, and they should work fine.



I have outlined the the simulate.py, but have not tested it yet, and I expect it to have some bugs. If you have time tonight, plese help me with it. Thanks!
